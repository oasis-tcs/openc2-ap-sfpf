OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in [GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work), are governed by the OASIS [TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process), [IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other policies.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to develop a stateful packet filter actuator profile. Actuator profiles identify the aspects of the OpenC2 language specification that are mandatory and/or meaningful in the context of a given actuator. Actuator Profiles also identify specifiers and options that are unique to the actuator. This repository will focus on the use of OpenC2 to issue commands and parse responses to a firewall.
